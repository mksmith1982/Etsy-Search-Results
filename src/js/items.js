"title": "Upcycled Wooden Wall Mount Guitar Hanger - Blue, Pink, Yellow & Purple",
"description": "Upcycled Wooden Guitar Wall Hanger - Available in Blue, Yellow & Purple\n\nThis is a handmade, recycled wood, wall mount guitar hanger that is finished with bright colored paint and finished with a beach driftwood look.  Other paint colors available on request.  Hangers are approximately 3.5&quot; x 5.5&quot;\n\nI started making these to hang my (too many) guitars and other stringed instruments, before realizing how popular they were.\n\nI have used these guitar hangers to hang my banjos, electric guitars (Fender, Gibson, Ibanez, Epiphone, Peavey, etc..) basses, and acoustic guitars (both 6 and 12-string).  If you have any questions about the fit of a certain instrument, please feel free to ask.  \n\nWe are not responsible for the secure hanging of your musical instrument.  Please choose the appropriate hardware for your specific installation, and mount securely.  The hanger is mounted using two screws into your wall... preferably into a stud, but I have used heavy duty drywall anchors successfully as well.\n\n**Please note: The U hook will be uninstalled for safe shipping purposes and will need to be reinstalled after you receive the item.  The wood may not be the exact stain color as the picture. Each piece of wood stains slightly different.  If you have any concern regarding color matching existing décor, please let us know and we can send a preview before mailing.***",

"description": "No more tangles for your earphone cords with this handy TuneTube! Thread the cord through the sleeve. The sleeve scrunches down when you want to use your earphones, and when it&#39;s time to put them away pull the sleeve back up and wrap them around the cute carrying case.   A velcro closure holds it all together.\n\n&quot;Bought so many earphone organizers before but none beats this.&quot;\n\n&quot;Your organizer is simply brilliant.  Way better than the tangled mess I&#39;m used to!&quot;\n\nThis has been designed for use with the cord of the Apple iPhone/iPod ear buds, but would work with any cord that had a maximum diameter of 3/8&quot; and a straight plug.\n\nSize when wrapped up:  2&quot; x 3&quot;.\n\nInstructions for use included.\n\n(This listing is for fabric TuneTube only; headphones not included.)\n\nAll available TuneTubes:  http://www.etsy.com/shop/relaine?section_id=11754362",

"description": "• 3 large accessory pockets for strings & more\n• Also holds up to 15 picks (plectrums)\n• Space enough for a fingerpicks tin\n• Choice of four styles\n• Also suitable for banjo accessories\n\nThis real leather guitar accessories wallet is specially designed for all the things every guitarist needs. It has three pockets, plus a picks holder that holds up to 15 picks (plectrums). The largest pocket holds a full set of spare strings. The second pocket is designed to hold a large capo* and/or a slide. A third pocket behind the pick holder takes cards and cash. These pockets are all nice and big (11cm/4&quot;) and will take many other items, such as an electronic tuner, fingerpicks tin, string winder, slide, etc. The wallet is still small enough to fit in the strings compartment of a hardshell guitar case.\n\nThis guitar strings wallet uses two bovine leathers. The main leather is 1mm thick vegetable tanned leather. The picks holder is made from a slightly thicker nubuck or similar with good spring to hold the picks nice and tight. The wallet is held closed with a high quality one inch elastic strap.\n\nComes in a cotton gift bag with either a free pick holder keyring, or a metal fingerpicks tin. See the options.\n\n• Rod&#39;s guarantee: If you don&#39;t love it, send it back! All costs refunded.\n• Designed and hand-crafted in Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire, England.\n• We ship worldwide, usually in 2 days\n• Check out our feedback - click the ***** button above.\n• Phone 07973 154888 (UK) or message me anytime for more details.\n\nTech spec:\nItem size: 120x120x15mm (4.5&quot; x 4.33&quot; x 0.5&quot;)\nItem weight: 85g (3oz) average\n\n*Many guitar players have a capo to help them play in different keys. It clamps across strings on the fretboard, and makes the whole guitar play at a higher pitch. Banjo players also use them.",

Our philosophy is simply to make beautiful things for people to enjoy.   We also believe they should be well made and long lasting, so we use high quality leather and strong thread.   The hardware (buckles etc) we use is high quality too, for example solid brass rather than plated.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please ask.

If there&#39;s stock shortage, we&#39;ll let you know what&#39;s happening and give you the option to cancel.\r\n\r\nIf you have paid using Paypal, and your Etsy and Paypal address differ, please let us know in the &quot;message to seller&quot; note during checkout.  If you do not notify us and we cannot reach you within 48 hours after payment we will ship the item to the address provided during Etsy checkout. \r\n\r\nAll items are sent via UK Royal Mail once your payment has been completed.  Typically it takes 10 days internationally.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you want insured or signed-for delivery.  We will let you know the additional postage cost as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nOrdering multiple items:\r\nWe have not specified postage for additional items as this will be dependent on the size and weight of the actual items ordered.   We will email you with the total cost after we receive your order.  You will then be able to change your order if you want to.  \r\n\r\nNon-UK customers:\r\nUK post office mailing prices are split into three world regions: \r\n- Europe, including all of the CIS, Turkey and Georgia.\r\n- World Zone 1: Generally covers North America, South America, Africa, Arabia and most of Asia.\r\n- World Zone 2: Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Pacific Islands.\r\n\r\nTo calculate postage costs yourself, use http://www.royalmail.com/price-finder.\r\nIn Step 1, select &quot;Overseas&quot;.  \r\nIn Step 2, select &quot;Small packet&quot; and the weight value stated in the product listing.  \r\nIn Step 3, select &quot;within 10 days&quot; in the top box and &quot;Less than £50&quot; in the bottom box.\r\nFinally click &quot;Find price&quot;.   Price options will then appear below.\r\n\r\nFrom these, let me know which you want to use.   &quot;International Signed For&quot; or &quot;Airsure&quot; is recommended.  For all other postage types we will be able to provide proof of postage as a matter of course.  \r\n\r\nCustoms (Non-UK customers only): \r\nBeware - your country may charge customs duty.  This will not necessarily happen but we need to warn you it is a possibility and nothing to do with Pinegrove Leather. If you are concerned about this, please check out  http://www.dutycalculator.com.   \r\n",

"policy_additional": "Please note that leather is an organic material and has the naturally occurring marks of any genuine animal skin: this is part of its natural beauty.   Where hair-on cowhide is part of the design, we have carefully chosen the pattern that will appear on every piece, and provide customers with options in terms of the balance of brown, white etc. ",

For many years luxury watchmakers have appreciated that stainless steel is an excellent choice for producing quality jewelry. It is hypo allergenic, does not rust, change color or tarnish. And because it is so durable, items crafted with it can be treasured for a lifetime.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n1. Our blanks ship with an easy to peel vinyl film to protect the shiny side until you are ready to use them and are made in the USA.\r\n\r\n2. If you are using GOOD QUALITY SHARP STAMPS, you only have to hit them slightly harder than you do for stamping silver, copper or brass - www.etsy.com/shop/StampingBlanks/search?search_query=&quot;Stamp+Set&quot;\r\n\r\n3. Stainless steel is a very strong durable metal and does not easily bend, which are very desirable qualities. However punch hole pliers & screw down punches will not work. The punches I have listed are modified so the hole can be set to 1/16&quot; from the blank edge (orig. only 1/4&quot; min.) & the pin opening is coated to prevent marring the blank. Hole punching is quick & easy in stainless steel & whatever other metal you&#39;re using. Demo video&#39;s: stampingblanks.com/StampingBlanks-How-To-Videos",

"policy_welcome": "Thank you for your interest in our stainless steel blanks!\r\nHOW TO VIDEO&#39;s at stampingblanks.com/StampingBlanks-How-To-Videos\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF STAINLESS STEEL (SST)\r\n\r\n1. Strong, durable, does not easily bend.\r\n2. Does not tarnish, rust or change color.\r\n3. Very affordable & quality that is trusted by luxury watchmakers.\r\n\r\nWHAT YOU NEED:\r\n\r\n1. A hammer, good solid working surface and a steel bench block (a)\r\n2. Quality, sharp letter/number & design stamps – the most important factor if working w/ SST is enjoyable or a challenge (b)\r\n3. A Premium or Power Punch make holes. NOTE: Punch hole pliers & screw down punches WILL NOT WORK. (c)\r\n4. Industrial grade or regular Sharpie to highlight lettering/designs, let dry at least 10 min. before removing excess. Traditional oxidizing techniques do not work on SST (d)\r\n5. A motorized buffer/polisher removes the excess Sharpie ink very quickly. Otherwise Mr. Clean - Magic Erasers do the job nicely.\r\n6. A sanding sponge works great if you wish to give the back or the front a brushed finish\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\nSave the protective film as you can re-attach it after stamping if you will be dapping, this will prevent marring the finish.\r\n\r\n(a) I use a 1 lb. (some prefer a 2 lb.) brass hammer to prevent mushrooming my stamps. I also use a 6x6 wood post (w/ boards attached at the bottom to stabilize it) to stamp on as a table acts as a sounding board and amplifies the noise. A  steel bench block w/ a rubber pad underneath your block will dramatically reduce noise.\r\n\r\n(b) LETTER/NUMBER STAMPS:\r\n\r\netsy.com/shop/StampingBlanks Affordable & long lasting\r\n\r\nThe &quot;Designer Stamp Sets&quot; by Infinity Stamps: infinitystamps.com/alphabet_stamps.html Always be sure to tell the sales associate that you plan to use your stamps on Stainless Steel.\r\n\r\nThe Supply Guy & the urban beader have reasonably priced and a large selection of designs, also has some letter sets good for SST too\r\n\r\nMetal Complex & the $20.00 letter sets at Hobby Lobby work well too.\r\n\r\nDESIGN STAMPS:\r\n\r\netsy.com/shop/theurbanbeader Reasonably priced and a large selection of designs, also has some letter sets good for SST too\r\n\r\nRio Grande’s “Precision Design Stamps” series are reasonably priced and a good selection of designs: riogrande.com/Search/Precision-Design-Stamps & riogrande.com/Search/Wave-Stamp-Sets\r\n\r\nRemember, dull stamps will result in faint impressions. I do not recommend the popular round shank design stamps. I know they are low cost and there are a lot of nice designs, but the fact is even new they are quite dull and scary to use on SST, I don’t even like using them on silver.\r\n\r\n(c) The die on the Power Punch can be screwed in/out to obtain the best leverage.\r\n\r\n(d) As an alternative some prefer to use automotive touch-up paint, you&#39;ll want to wipe excess off quickly.",

Tracking information at Stamps.com or usps.com will only show when the item was accepted at the Post Office and when &quot;Processed through Sort Facility&quot; which means that it has left the US, at that point no further information will be available. You may try the customs/tracking number at your postal service website :)\r\n\r\nThe DHL upgrade is the fastest delivery option but note the some customers have mentioned they had to pay higher customs duty fees than USPS shipments.\r\n\r\nIF YOUR PACKAGE DOES NOT ARRIVE:\r\n\r\nOPTION 1.

We reserve the right to issue refunds solely at our discretion. Items returned to me without prior authorization and/or without contact information clearly visible on the outside of the package will be refused and returned to sender. Exchanges will be for the full original purchase price excluding all shipping costs. Allowed refunds will be for the original purchase price excluding all shipping costs and will incur a 20% restocking fee. No refunds or exchanges will be allowed on any items that have had the protective film removed or custom items. ",
"policy_additional": "Buying blanks without holes has these advantages :)\r\n\r\n1. Less production time - faster to stamp and punch the hole afterward rather than to align stamping to an existing hole\r\n2. Save .25 cents on each blank buying them w/o holes - the savings will pay for a punch in no time\r\n3. Ability to punch multiple holes if your design requires it & positioned according to your needs\r\n4. Flexibility to make smaller holes if you prefer\r\n\r\nThe Premium Punch ($99.00 w/ Kit, $75.00 Punch ONLY) is made in the USA and is the one the Power Punch ($42.50) is designed after. It is higher quality and if used w/ the optional bench mount** ($35.00) is considerably faster and easier to punch holes. If you do not have a workbench it can be mounted to a board and a C clamp or bar clamp could be used to attach it temporarily to your table. The Power Punch is a good economical tool that will get the job done too.\r\n\r\nPremium Punch KIT - www.etsy.com/shop/StampingBlanks/search?search_query=Premium+Kit\r\nPremium Punch ONLY - www.etsy.com/shop/StampingBlanks/search?search_query=ONLY\r\nPower Punch KIT - www.etsy.com/shop/StampingBlanks/search?search_query=&quot;Power+Punch&quot;+Kit\r\n\r\nPUNCH ACCESSORIES:\r\nPremium Punch MOUNT - www.etsy.com/shop/StampingBlanks/search?search_query=Mount\r\nIndividual Punch Pin/Die - www.etsy.com/shop/StampingBlanks/search?search_query=Individual\r\n\r\nSee punch demonstration video&#39;s at:  stampingblanks.com/StampingBlanks-How-To-Videos",

"title": "Mark Knopfler&#39;s National Style 0 Limited Edition Fine Art Print A3 size",
"description": "This A3-sized Limited Edition Fine Art Print features a detailed hand drawn illustration of Mark Knopfler&#39;s National Style 0 by George Morgan.\n\nThis print comes from a limited edition print run consisting of just 95 pieces. Each print will be signed and individually numbered by hand in soft pencil by the artist prior to despatch. \nProduced on thick 300 gsm silk art paper this Limited Edition Print is suitable for framing with or without a mount and will be supplied in a protective cellophane bag inside a sturdy cardboard postal tube.\n\nMark Knopfler&#39;s National Style 0.\nThe Style O resonator guitar was one of the strongest icons of Hawaiian music, carrying etched images of palm trees, canoes, clouds and stars.\nIntroduced in 1930, the first Style O had a nickel-plated steel body, which was soon changed to brass and throughout the 1930&#39;s the model evolved as many design changes were implemented, including frets increased from 12 to 14, the sieve hole cover plate grew four ribs in 1932 and then changed to a diamonds and arrows pattern around 1935. The f-holes were originally straight-cut, then from 1933 the edges were rolled and in 1936 the fingerboard changed from dyed black maple to solid ebony, then in 1937 the parallelogram fretboard inlays replaced pearl dots and the headstock received a black celluloid veneer. Imagery detail also changed with palm trees moving from one side to the other, stars and clouds fading, lagoon ripples changing and the whole canoe image reversing direction.\nThe majority were round-necks, as Hawaiian players switched to electrics as they became available but this model’s greatest exposure came fifty years later when Dire Straits released Brothers in Arms in 1985 and suddenly the 14-fret version of the Style O with diamond-and-arrows cover plate became the hottest resonator in town, now famous as the &#39;Dire Straits model&#39;.\n\nSize 420mm x 297mm (16.54&quot; x 11.69&quot;)",

"description": "This A3-sized Limited Edition Fine Art Print features a detailed hand drawn illustration of David Gilmour’s Black Stratocaster, by George Morgan.\n\nThis print comes from a limited edition print run consisting of just 95 pieces. Each print will be signed and individually numbered by hand in soft pencil by the artist prior to despatch. \nProduced on thick 300 gsm silk art paper this Limited Edition Print is suitable for framing with or without a mount and will be supplied in a protective cellophane bag inside a sturdy cardboard postal tube.\n\nDavid Gilmour’s Black Stratocaster.\nDavid purchased this Black Stratocaster in New York during Pink Floyd’s 1970 North American tour. This 1969 model with maple fingerboard and large headstock was originally finished in sunburst and had been refinished in black at Manny’s. Making its debut at the Bath Festival in June 1970, David has had most of the components changed over the years including the fingerboard, pickups, tuners, pickguard, bridge and tremolo arm. It was also modified with different selector switches and a Gibson PAF humbucker in the 70’s. Widely regarded as his favourite guitar, David has played this Black Strat on numerous recordings and live performances throughout his time with Pink Floyd and as a solo artist.\n\nSize 420mm x 297mm (16.54&quot; x 11.69&quot;)",

"title": "Handmade Pottery Mug ceramics and pottery Banjo Mug green and brown by Jewel Pottery",
"description": "Handmade Pottery Banjo mug, made to order so you can pick your colors from my shop. If you do not convo me about the color of the mug, it will be made in dark green with a brown top as the 1st pic shows! Thanks!\n\nby Jewel Pottery\n\nMade to order ready to ship in 2-3 weeks,  if you need one sooner convo me I may have one or be able to get it out sooner, or check out my ready to ship section https://www.etsy.com/shop/jewelpottery?ref=listing-shop2-all-items-count§ion_id=5940735\n\nHI FOLKS, I AM UPDATING MY LISTINGS,, FIRST WITH SO MANY MUGS ON ETSY WHY BUY MY MUGS??\n\nWell, as an artist specializing in mugs for 23 years I look at mugs a lot. Here is what I can tell you; my mugs are well thought out and cater to function. Here are the reasons why you should buy one of my pottery mugs and feel the difference;\n\n1. The handles are thicker, more comfortable to hold than others, hand pulled (not extruded) and fit snug in the grove of your hand. You can fit your hand into them and they are very comfortable to hold. \n\n2. White inside for easy cleaning and you can see that it is clean.\n\n3. The lip of the mug is rounded and the size of the lip is not to big or too thin, well made for easy sipping\n\n4. The size of my mugs is right about 14-16 oz,, most are about 16 but I say 14 to be on the safe side. If yours is made to order tell me you want 16 or 8oz and I will make it that way. 16 oz fits most cans or bottles of beverages. \n\n5. They keep coffee good and hot, and with the comfort of the handle you will not have to figure a way to hold your hot mug.\n\n6. The colors are vibrant and alive, soon to become your favorite mug on the shelf. All mugs are dishwasher and microwave safe.\n\n7. My designs are made from hand carved stamps not from a rubber stamp made in a factory\n\n8. I have put a lot thought into the design and colors. I think you will notice the difference. If your not completely satisfied, send it back and I will make you another or refund your money. \n\nI learned to throw clay on the potter&#39;s wheel in college,, many late nights eating pizza by the wheel. After college I moved to Seagrove NC to become a professional potter. I practiced on a wheel that was once Dorothy Auman Cole&#39;s. She was a 7th generation potter. Dorothy had passed before I got there. However her ware that had not been glaze fired was in a chicken coop near where I worked. Every day I would start the day examining one of her pieces with my hands closing my eyes finding the piece. She created ware that was exceptionally functional and beautiful. I believe she guided me and helped me to be where I am today. Thank you Dorothy\n\nCanadian buyers; Shipping has increased drastically very sorry but 14.75 per mug is what it costs to ship, thanks\n\n\nTHIS LISTING IS FOR THESE MUGS ONLY.

The colors will be similar as will the shape and style of the mug. However, this is handmade pottery and each item is individual and different, especially with all of the color variations and stamps I work with. Sometimes there will be a drip of glaze or a stamp slightly crooked, if you look at my store you can see this in my pics I am not a perfection potter I am an artistic potter and quality pieces of art is what you will receive. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nJust to let you know you can shop Jewel Pottery and receive many Ready to Ship items at your door within 2-3 days.*  Items from my READY TO SHIP section are ready to be shipped out to their new homes, however many mugs are made to order and it will say in the listing.

The reason for this is pottery takes time to dry and fire.  On any day I am usually working on wholesale orders of 100 - 300 that are in line in head of your order.  If I can make it by your date I will, however due to the nature of clay and kiln firing a quick order is never 100% guaranteed.  Thanks so much for your patience and understanding.  I appreciate your purchasing hand made ware. \r\n\r\n",

Many products are ready to be shipped out to their new homes and can be to your home in 2-3 days. However many are also made to order so check the listing to see which your item is. If you need something shipped today or tomorrow shop my ready to ship section.  If you love something that is made to order but short on time check with me via convo as I may be able to get something out pretty quick.   Thanks!   \r\n\r\n (*Shipping will be about 2-4 weeks for Canada but can take longer depending on the time of year, ect. but we get them out ASAP!!!!)\r\n\r\nMy mugs are all handmade by me, and I believe there is beauty and art in imperfection. So there may be a drop of one glaze on top of another, or a stamp that is slightly crooked, this is all part of my style and how I intend my ware to be.  I feel my style is spontaneous and free, something you can not buy at a superstore.\r\n\r\nIf you are ordering a made to order item, please know that the item in the pic is not the item you will receive.  The colors will be similar as will the shape and style of the mug. However, this is handmade pottery and each item is individual and different, especially with all of the color variations and stamps I work with.  If  you do not like the item you receive please feel free to ship it back (at your expense)  for a refund or a remake.  Returns must be shipped back within 15 days of receiving the item.\r\n Thank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n",

"title": "Guitar, Snowman, Ornament, Violin, Baby Bottle & Potion Bottle Cookie Cutter Designed By Whisked Away Cutters - **Guideline Sketches Below**",
"description": "When a customer asked if I could design a guitar cutter, I had in mind to do one that would be sturdy and not susceptible to cookie breakage. As you can see, I had fun coming up with different uses for this cutter as well.\n\nI will be including Guideline Sketches should anyone wish to use either as as guide as soon as I can get them posted. You will find them under the photos of the cutter. To save them, click on the photo, right click to either &quot;Save Image&quot; or &quot;Copy Image&quot;. From there paste into Word or whichever program you like. You can then resize it from there as needed and then print it to either follow along or to place on a KopyKake.\n\nWhisked Away Cutters are finely crafted cutters for cookies and fondant, designed by a cookie decorator for cookie decorators. Crafted with rounded corners on the handle for comfort, a reinforced area near the base of the handle and strong walls going down to a fine tapered edge for a precise, clean cut. Please see the cutter side view example in the close up photo of The Vicki plaque cutter shown above in the thumbnail photos.\n\n** Food safe PLA cutters are HAND WASH ONLY, not dishwasher safe, cannot be used to cut hot and should not be left to soak in hot water. This is an aspect of all food safe PLA cutters. Care must be given to the specialized tapered cutting edge when storing as it can get nicked or damaged if hit with another cutter or sharp object. Proper care will ensure years of use from your Whisked Away Cutters. \n\nMaryann, The Cookie Artisan, recently had this to say, &quot;I love how your cutters feel in my hands and how comfortable the edges feel as I cut cookies! Used my first cutter to cut 350 cookies and the edges on the last cookie looked as great as the first cookie!&quot;\n\nCutter prices are determined by print time and the amount of PLA used. Cutters with intricate shapes and curves or larger sizes take longer to print and are priced accordingly. \n\nCurrent shipping time is shown on our home page beneath the banner at https://www.etsy.com/shop/whiskedawaycutters  Shipping for our shop is done via USPS First Class Mail, which is listed as 3 - 5 days on average. Priority Mail is listed as 2 - 3 days on average and is available for purchase as a separate item. Again, shipping times are not guaranteed. Please bear in mind the normal order processing time that is shown. We will make all efforts to expedite your order when Priority Mail is selected, but it will be a matter of the number of orders already placed. Please see &quot;Shipping & Policies&quot; for more shop information.",

"announcement": "Thank you for stopping by Whisked Away Cutters!  Our current processing time before shipping is 2 - 3 days, but I will ship out sooner when at all possible.  Welcome to Whisked Away Cutters, finely crafted cutters designed by a cookie decorator for cookie decorators!  You can see all designs on Instagram @WhiskedAwayCutters or at www.facebook.com/WhiskedAwayCutters.  Our shop was born out of the need to have precise and unique cutter shapes for my professional cookie business, The Cookie Connoisseur LLC.  Over the years I have been asked by many if they could purchase my cutters and now we are able to have them to offer for sale.\r\n\r\nWhisked Away Cutters are designed by a cookie decorator for cookie decorators with steps taken to produce a top level product.  Although they could be produced faster and less expensive, our cutters are designed with smooth strong walls, an additional reinforced area where the handle is attached and then going down to an all-important thinner tapered cutting edge.  This makes for a smooth, clean cut with excellent results.  Admittedly, our cutters are a tad ‘overdesigned’ due to these efforts, but we feel that it makes for a product that we feel good putting our name on and decorators will be happy to use.\r\n\r\nOur cutters produced with a 3d printer and are made with the highest quality food safe PLA, a food grade plant based plastic.  They require certain care in they are HAND WASH ONLY and are not dishwasher safe, as that can damage or melt the PLA.  Along those lines they are not to be soaked in hot water, used to cut hot cookies or exposed to high heat.  Hand washing in hot, soapy water is the proper care. As well, to prevent damage to the tapered edge, please store carefully in order that other cutters or additional items will not hit and damage them. Whisked Away Cutters is not responsible for damage caused by improper care of the cutters.  Proper care will ensure a long, happy life for your cutters.\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________\r\nSHIPPING:\r\n*** Domestic Shipping: \r\nUSPS raised its rates on Jan. 17 and shipping changes have been made to meet those increases.

"title": "Blue Landscape Framed Mixed Media Collage Art Free USA shipping Ready to Hang",
"description": "Blue Landscape is an original mixed media artwork, matted, signed and framed on stretched canvas. This piece is part of a series of stitched collages I have made over my 30 year career. I often work with a mix of paper, fabric and transfers of my imagery, layered onto painted narrative text. All is then intricately stitched. For me, the rhythmic action of stitching in and out, back and forth, over and under, creates not only texture, but memory. The hand of the artist is always present, helping to reveal the story of the artwork. For this piece: Beginning with a journal entry on painted fabric, this woman was a reminder to me to value the processes of making, doing, being, living. Let it be your reminder!\n\nThe piece measures 10&quot; x 10&quot;, and was newly created for a recent collage exhibition, Piecing it All Together, and you can see it installed with a companion piece at the exhibit in the last picture. Here is a link to my blog post about the exhibit, with more pictures from the show: http://www.gaylepritchard.blogspot.com/2011/04/art-of-collage-exhibit-opening-crowded.html\nand the companion piece, Lady Blue, is listed in my shop here: https://www.etsy.com/listing/121472937/mixed-media-collage-lady-blue-framed-art\n\nFree domestic shipping is included in your purchase. Buy both pieces together, and receive 10% off: USE THIS CODE at checkout for your discount: COOLARTNOW\n\nMaterials: hand shibori dyed paper on canvas, paint, stitching, paper, guitar strings, beads, various threads, iridescent organza, metal rods and screening on canvas; found paper; transferred imagery on unprimed canvas, narrative text\n\nTechniques: Hand stitched, embroidered, appliqued, painted, collaged; drawing and writing on canvas, layered disperse dye image transfers. \n\nI have more mixed media artwork in my shop here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/NoMoonNight?ref=hdr_shop_menu&section_id=12660696\n\nThanks for looking.

"description": "This silver toned guitar bookmark is an affordable gift for music teachers, musicians and amateur guitar players.\n\nThe guitar bookmark comes with a Tibetan silver bookmark base, your choice of beads, and a silver toned heart charm. Check out our Metal Bookmarks section for more teacher bookmark options.\n\nLooking for more bookmarks? Check out our collection:\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/charmphilosophy\n\nLike our Charm Philosophy Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/CharmPhilosophy to view updates on new products.\n\nOr, follow us on Twitter: twitter.com/CharmPhilosophy\n\nIf you&#39;re struggling for gift ideas, all of our products make great stocking stuffers. Follow this link to view more: www.etsy.com/shop/charmphilosophy\n\nFeel free to contact me with any questions. Most of our items can be customized.\n\n*** FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ***\n\nQ: How can I track my package?\n\nI&#39;m sorry, we cannot provide a tracking number. We are shipping using Canada Post&#39;s Light Packet Parcel Service. In order to obtain tracking information, it costs anywhere from $17 to $66 in shipping fees, depending on where the package is being shipped to. If it is essential that you have a tracking number and are willing to pay the additional shipping fee, please contact me before purchasing.\n\nQ: Why hasn&#39;t my package arrived yet?\n\nWe are a Canada-based company. Items shipping from Canada take an average of about 10-14 days to arrive at it&#39;s destination. Please allow 3 weeks (or sometimes more) during the Christmas season, as the postal service and customs gets extremely backed up.\n\nQ: I want to buy a gift. Can I pay for priority shipping to get it here by the end of the week?\n\nWe offer an shipping upgrade add-on Canada Post&#39;s Xpresspost Service, which guarantees arrival in 4 business days. You can add that to your order here: http://etsy.me/1vCmGoc\n\nQ: Can I add additional charms or beads to my necklace?\n\nAbsolutely! View our Add-ons section to find the listings for both.\n\nQ: I want to buy in bulk. Do you have more of this item than what is listed?\n\nIn most cases, yes. Feel free to send me a inquiry.\n\nIf you have anymore questions, please ask :) Thank you for checking out Charm Philosophy.",

"description": "Grateful Dead Set of 4 Coasters\n\nEach coaster is handmade with natural stone. They are approx. 4” x 4” with slight variations in tile and image size. Each image responds differently to the sealing agent making each coaster unique and one-of-a-kind. The coaster is backed with cork to protect your table surfaces and prevent slipping. The coaster has been sealed to ensure many years of use with hot and cold beverages.\n\nCoaster is not dishwasher safe, and should just be wiped clean with a damp cloth if needed.\n\nCoaster will vary from picture due to the character and texture of the stone and the sealing process.\n\nAll orders are made to order. Please allow 2-3 weeks to receive, based on how many orders I have.",

"description": "Original oil painting, hand painted by a professional portrait artist with 20+ years experience.  \n\n- Portraits in all shapes and sizes, scroll down to see sizes, custom sizes available\n- Ships in 2-4 weeks\n- Trained professional artist\n- Custom modifications available on request – change color, add/remove details etc.\n- Worldwide shipping\n- 100% satisfaction guaranteed \n\n\nTHE PROCESS\n\nSTEP 1 – The Ordering Process\nThe painting has sold. Your painting will be created in the same style, color and size as seen in the listing you purchased. Each reproduced painting may have unique minor variances but will stay very true to the original.\n\nSTEP 2 – The Painting Process\nYou’ve placed your order, and now my work begins. I use very high quality canvas and paint materials to bring your photograph to produce your painting. I use stunning oils in a process that uses a trained eye and a steady hand.  Most portraits can be finished within a 5-8 days although some extra time might be needed for drying. \n\nSTEP 3 – Delivery\nThe finished painting is carefully rolled and shipped in a tube. Gallery wrap  or  framing available at extra cost; see below. \n\n\n\nFRAMING\nPlease note, stretching and framing not included with purchase. Framing and gallery wrapping services I offer include:\n\nGallery wrapping - Your finished painting is stretched onto a solid wood frame with the canvas wrapped around the back and hanging hardware attached.  It arrives ready to hang. \n\nFraming - I work very closely with my preferred framer who has framed 100’s of my paintings; his price and craftsmanship are hard to beat. Your local framer would charge you close to twice the amount.  Convo me if you would like help in choosing a suitable.   High quality hand crafted Italian wood frames, professionally stretched and framed. \n\n** Send me a message for help in purchasing your gallery wrap or frame.",
